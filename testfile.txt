The goals of SUAMI are twofold: (1) to expose students to the nature, culture, and rigors of research in pure and applied mathematics by working on a research project in collaboration with other program participants with faculty and postdoctoral mentors; (2) to give the students a taste of the graduate school experience to help them make an informed decision on whether they should attend graduate school, as well as inform them about other possible career paths in mathematics. SUAMI is part of the Summer Scholars Program run by the Mellon College of Science at Carnegie Mellon, and SUAMI students will have opportunities to participate in the academic, cultural, and social programs of the larger MCS summer community.
